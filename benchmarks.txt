Benchmarks on 3.1GHz Intel Core i5 (macOS Mojave 10.14.5)

committing to an n-vector: 270n microseconds
proving a single element in an n-vector: 270n microseconds
verifying a single proof: 5400 microseconds (regardless of n)
updating a proof: 270 microseconds (regardless of n)
updating a commitment: 270 microseconds (regardless of n)

commitments and proofs are 48 bytes

Room for improvement on individual operations:
- Using multi-exponentiation and fixed-based precomputation, commit and prove can each be improved by about 5x-10x
- Using fixed-based precomputation, updating commitments and proofs can be improved by about 2x-4x
- Verifying cannot be improved much -- I'd be surprised if we could get 1.5x improvement

Room for improvement via batching:
- Proving for multiple values on a single commitment will cost at most 2x proving for a single value (as long as you produce a single combined proof, which will require all the values to which it refers in order to verify)
- Verifying for multiple values on a single commitment should cost about the same as verifying a single value
- Proofs for multiple values on the same commitment can be combined very cheaply, and will remain 48 bytes
